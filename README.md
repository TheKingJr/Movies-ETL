# Amazing Prime Video Hackathon Analysis Challenge 8

## Overview of Project

Amazing Prime Video wanted to create an algorithm that would predict which low-budget movie would become popular in the future. In order to do this and have fun with it, they hosted a hackathon. Although, for this hackathon to be successful, a member of the Amazing Prime Video team needed to clean up three datasets from Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens prior to the event. Once the datasets were cleaned and ready, they transformed them into one singular clean dataset and loaded into an sql database. The theory behind this task involved ETL which means to Extract, Transform, and Load. The following deliverables found below were achieved using ETL. 

- Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files

- Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data

- Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data

- Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
